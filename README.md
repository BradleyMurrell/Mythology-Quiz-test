# Mythology Quiz

## Summary

### The Mythology Quiz tests the user on their knowledge of mythology from different cultures.

### The user is given ten multiple choice questions with the option to choose from one of four answers. The results are tallied and shows the user how many questions they have answered correctly which is displayed under the questions and a final score when the quiz is completed.

### The user can create a username and save their score at the end of the quiz. The score is saved locally. The quiz can be replayed again as many times as they like. The questions are displayed in random order so that each time the quiz is taken, the questions are not in the same order as the last.

## Bugs

* Fixed
  * Questions were not displaying correctly. The innerText under Fetch() needed to be changed to innerHTML.

* Unfixed
  * Before submitting project, I tested the site one last time. After answering the questions I got an error page. I have checked everything but cannot find the cause of the error. I have unfortunately run out of time to resolve the error.
